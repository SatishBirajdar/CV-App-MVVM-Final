# CV-App-MVVM-Final

“CV-App” includes following:
- Resume details (Name, Contact, Summary, Skills, Experience)
- These details are fetched from a mock host (www.mocky.io)
- It follows MVVM pattern, with some future dependency injection (best-practise) approach.
- UI is programmatically created and is well organized.
- It also handles network errors. (JSON parsing error and No internet connection)
- Unit test: since app’s functionality is just to display host data on the screen, there isn’t any computation/logic happening to test. So any unit testing is not needed that I believe.
- Integration testing:
    - added api endpoint testing and successful response testing.
- Some UI testing.
- Inline comments.
- It doesn’t uses any external library for API call.
